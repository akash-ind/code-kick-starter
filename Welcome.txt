About the Program!
======================

Title:		 Code-Kick-Starter
Language Used: 	 C++
Aim of Project:	 Originally created with an aim of doing FASTER CODE SUBMISSIONS in C/C++, for ONLINE PROGRAMMING COMPETITIONS.

Features:	 (1) Automatically includes user-modifiable code template into a C/C++ file, subject to file extension.
		 
	 	 (2) Detects beforehand on whether the specified filename is already existent, in either of ".c" or ".cpp" extensions, if not 			     specified otherwise. If file exists, it simply opens it. Else a new file is created with the user-defined code template.

	         (3) Automatically opens specified file (whether new or already existent) using user-modifiable Editor/IDE.
		
	         (4) Default file extension for unspecified file types is ".cpp" .
		     Eg: just typing "code filename" will create "filename.cpp".

		 (5) Maintains a log file containing a Timestamp along with specified file name for each usage of this program, that acts as a 			     reference. Also maintains count of number of times the program is used.
		
	         (6) Bug-Free code. :)
